The data gathered for this machine learning model consists of many different attributes to predict a student's performance grade. The final performance grade can be referred to as the target. 
Some of these features are age, sex, family size, past grades, absences, and internet access. To briefly introduce the problem, the model is being created to identify students who may need additional assistance and interventions
